# TCACalc
A demonstration of a calculator app inspired by Apple, written in Swift using [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture). 


## Usage
Please note that NO permission is granted or implied to use this software in any way. This app is for educational purposes only. Not intended for release of any kind.

The reason for this is that the app is heavily inspired by the design of the stock Apple Calculator app. While I would like to contribute to the community and allow others to benefit from my learning, I need to be prepared in case I receive a takedown notice. 

If you have a suggestion for licensing, please raise a GitHub issue. Suggestions are greatly appreciated.
